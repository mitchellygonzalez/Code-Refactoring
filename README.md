## Description
Code refactoring is a common task for front-end and junior developers. This relates to taking functional 
existing code and making it better by removing anything that may seem redundant. It also includes making it 
clearer for others to to read, such as choosing a dynamic that divides code into different sections, or groups
together any excessive code. This makes an application more accessible, and that is what this project is 
geared towards.
